module 5 challenge Columbia Fintech Bootcamp

# Purpose
I developed a tool to help credit union members evaluate their financial health. The tool is able to assess monthly budgets and forecast a retirement plan. These forcasts are based on members' current holdings including cryptocurrencies, stocks and bonds.

# Two Financial Tools
1) This tool has a financial planner for emergencies to vizualize the client's current savings
2) This tool also has a financial planner for retirement that forecassts the performance of the client's retirement portfolio in 10 or 30 years.
